# gnbsim

The gnbsim repository enables the building of a multi-container and multi-node cluster of gNbsim using Docker. This allows you to run gNbsim simulations on multiple VMs, with the flexibility to run multiple containers on each VM.

To download the gnbsim repository, use the following command:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/onf-internship/gnbsim.git
```

## Step-by-Step Installation
To install gnbsim, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker by running `make gnbsim-docker-install`.
2. Configure the network for gnbsim:
   - Set the "data_iface" parameter to the network interface name of the machine.
   - Set "macvlan_iface" to the name of the macvlan interface to be created.
   - Set "macvlan_network_name" to the name of the Docker network to be created.
   - Set "subnet_prefix" to the first two bytes of the subnet, which should correspond to the "ran_subnet" of 5g-core or the machine's subnet.
3. Start the gNbsim Docker containers using `make gnbsim-docker-start`:
   - Set the container "image" for gNbsim.
   - Set "prefix" to the desired name for the gNbsim containers.
   - Set "count" to the number of containers to be instantiated on each VM.
4. Start the simulation:
   - Set "amf.ip" to the IP address of the core machine.
   - Set "ueid_base" to the starting IMSI number.
     - Each container will have a different starting IMSI number.
   - Set "ue_per_pod" to the number of UEs on each gNbsim container.
   - Set the "gnbsims" array with a list of key-value pairs:
     - Each key represents the container number (numeric).
     - The corresponding value `config_file` is the config template file for gNbsim.
   - Run `make gnbsim-simulator-start`.
5. Check the results:
   - Enter one of the Docker containers using `docker exec -it *prefix*-1 bash`.
   - Use `cat summary.log` to view the last result.
   - To check the logs generated by gnbsim, use `cat *gnbsim*.log`.

### One-Step Installation
To install gnbsim in one go, run `make gnbsim-simulator-setup-install`.

### Uninstall
To uninstall gnbsim, run `make gnbsim-simulator-setup-uninstall`.
